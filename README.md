This is a project I'm building to follow along with this Udemy Course:

In this section of the course I'm going to learn more about:

- Input handling.
- Creating an enemy class.
- Instantiate and manage projectiles.
- Create the core gameplay loop; health, damage & destruction.
- Adding particle & sound effects.
- Victory/Defeat conditions & accompanying HUD.
