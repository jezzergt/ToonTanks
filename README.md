In this section of the course I'm hoping to learn more about the following:

> Input handling.
> Creating an enemy class.
> Instantiate and manage projectiles.
> Create the core gameplay loop; health, damage & destruction.
> Adding particle & sound effects.
> Victory/Defeat conditions & accompanying HUD.
